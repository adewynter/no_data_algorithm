# The No-Data Algorithm
Code and data for the paper 'Labelling Data With Unkown References', by Adrian de Wynter. 
This paper shows that it is possible to ascertain trust in an evaluator via an algorithm (the No-Data Algorithm). The algorithm has some stats to show that it adjusts to the predictions, but my favourite bit is that it works with a formal proof. 

The code in this repository is for repro purposes.
